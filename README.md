# Movie Search App

### This app was created to test and demonstrate the power of connecting to APIs

I used Open Movie Data Base (OMDB) to create a simple movie search web app. 
This project uses:
- react, 
- Axios, 
- Bootstrap

#### Installation & use

1. clone Repo
2. launch the app from terminal in root directory: `npm start`
3. app should be visible at localhost:3000
4. Search for movies in the search bar.
